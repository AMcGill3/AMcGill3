Hi, I'm Alec McGill. In May 2025 I completed the software engineering track of the Makers Academy bootcamp, where I gained a proficiency in Python, JavaScript (node and React), SQL, HTML, and CSS. I particularly enjoy the design aspect of software development but I'm just as happy working in the backend. I'm mainly interested in frontend development but I'm open to any opportunity where I can put the skills I've learned over the last year to use.
