Hi, I'm Alec McGill. In May 2025 I completed the software engineering track of the Makers Academy bootcamp, where I gained a proficiency in Python, JavaScript (node and React), SQL, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently working on a version of the game Metrodle (https://metrodle.com) but with the tube in Santiago in Chile instead of London as a way to keep my skills sharp, where I've especially learned a lot about CSS and scheduling using cron. I particularly enjoy the design aspect of software development but I'm just as happy working in the backend. I'm mainly interested in frontend development but I'm open to any opportunity where I can put the skills I've learned over the last year to use.
